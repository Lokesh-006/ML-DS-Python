        "  Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and the use of data. It enables computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms are designed to become more accurate and effective as they process more data, and they are used in various applications, such as image recognition, voice assistants, recommendation systems, self-driving cars, and predictive analytics. The three main types of machine learning are supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning."

        "If we use the test set to tune hyperparameters, we risk overfitting to that specific dataset. This means that our model may become overly optimized for the test set and might not generalize well to new, unseen data. As a result, when we deploy our model in real-world scenarios, its performance may be lower than expected because it hasn't learned to generalize beyond the specific examples in the test set. Essentially, the purpose of the test set is to provide an unbiased evaluation of the final model's performance, and using it for hyperparameter tuning compromises this evaluation by introducing bias."
